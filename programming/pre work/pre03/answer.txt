main prints “No, I”  followed by a space; zoop is then called invoking baffle which prints “wug” ; ping is then invoked which prints “.” 

Because ping uses println, on a new line zoop then prints “You wugga” followed by a space and invokes baffle again outputting “wug” and then calls ping that outputs  “.” 


On a new line, main then outputs “I” followed by a space and baffle is invoked again printing “wug” followed by  “.” 

Output:
No, I wug. 
You wugga wug.
I wug.

main - zoop
zoop - baffle
baffle - ping
ping - “ . “

*Since ping is called in baffle, if you invoke baffle at the end of ping it will be recursive and call itself continuously
